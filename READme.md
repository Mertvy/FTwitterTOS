# Disclamer: Machine learning model and hashtag categorization were trained on datasets containing hate speech and slurs. Files containing hate speech and other negative keywords have been ommitted from the repository.

# Twitter Political Sentiment Analysis


This project is based on Co:Here's challenge to create a trained sentiment and language processing application. It is also inspired by the Berggruen Institutes Challenge to create a product that facilitates deliberation in a community by presenting current political trends in tweets. We used the twitter API, tweepy to compare current tweets to datasets we gathered from the internet. These datasets will be referenced at the end of this document.

# Prompts For Challange

#### Best Build with Cohere

Cohere helps developers generate or analyze text to do things like write and summarize copy, moderate content, classify data and more, all at a massive scale. No matter your level of experience, Cohere's API makes it easy to build machine learning and state-of-the-art language AI into your application.

Build something awesome that showcases the best use of Cohere's API for a chance to win some incredible prizes!

#### Berggruen Institute Challenge

Build a program that facilitates deliberation and decision-making among residents in a community. First you must identify the problem you want to solve and substantiate your choice by demonstrating it is of concern to the community you have selected. Then you need to build and app that will recruit a randomly selected, representative sample of the population (you can do this via web scraping). Finally, you will populate the program with important information necessary for the recruited representative to make an informed decision concerning the problem and will facilitate a voting of decision-making process in an unbiased way. Our political institutions are suffering from declining trust a legitimacy and it is time we think about ways to reinvent democracy. Among the experiments being developed are new institutions for citizen engagement but few of them are scalable. We need to leverage technology to harness the collective intelligence of citizens in solving shared problem in their communities.
